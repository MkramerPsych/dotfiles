# My dotfiles ~ Configuration and Customization

### Requirements

    Git
    Curl
    Bash or Zsh

### Install

No prep necessary! Install the dotfiles directly to your $HOME directory (with backup of all conflicting files to $HOME/.dots-backup) by running:

`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MkramerPsych/dotfiles/master/.bin/install.sh | $SHELL`

This requires the public key of the machine where the setup is being installed to be registered as authorized on Github.
