# My dotfiles ~ Configuration and Customization

### Requirements

    Git
    Curl

### Install

Install config tracking in your $HOME by running:

`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MkramerPsych/dotfiles/master/.bin/install.sh | $SHELL`

This requires the public key of the machine where the setup is being installed to be registered as authorized on Bitbucket.
